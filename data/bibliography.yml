  abstract: 'We show how the success of deep learning depends not only on mathematics
    but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that
    neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions
    of practical interest can be approximated through “cheap learning” with exponentially
    fewer parameters than generic ones, because they have simplifying properties tracing
    back to the laws of physics. The exceptional simplicity of physics-based functions
    hinges on properties such as symmetry, locality, compositionality and polynomial
    log-probability, and we explore how these properties translate into exceptionally
    simple neural networks approximating both natural phenomena such as images and
    abstract representations thereof such as drawings. We further argue that when
    the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form
    prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient
    than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss
    the relation to renormalization group procedures. We prove various “no-flattening
    theorems” showing when such efficient deep networks cannot be accurately approximated
    by shallow ones without efficiency loss: flattening even linear functions can
    be costly, and flattening polynomials is exponentially expensive; we use group
    theoretic techniques to show that n variables cannot be multiplied using fewer
    than 2\^n neurons in a single hidden layer.'

  title: Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors
  container-title: arXiv:1207.0580 \[cs\]
  page: '18'
  note: 'citecount: 01870 arXiv: 1207.0580'
  abstract: When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training
    set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This “overfitting” is
    greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training
    case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only
    helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each
    neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the
    correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in
    which it must operate. Random “dropout” gives big improvements on many benchmark
    tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.

  title: The Dropout Learning Algorithm
  container-title: Artificial intelligence
  page: '78-122'
  volume: '210'
  note: 'citecount: 00068'
  abstract: 'Dropout is a recently introduced algorithm for training neural network
    by randomly dropping units during training to prevent their co-adaptation. A mathematical
    analysis of some of the static and dynamic properties of dropout is provided using
    Bernoulli gating variables, general enough to accommodate dropout on units or
    connections, and with variable rates. The framework allows a complete analysis
    of the ensemble averaging properties of dropout in linear networks, which is useful
    to understand the non-linear case. The ensemble averaging properties of dropout
    in non-linear logistic networks result from three fundamental equations: (1) the
    approximation of the expectations of logistic functions by normalized geometric
    means, for which bounds and estimates are derived; (2) the algebraic equality
    between normalized geometric means of logistic functions with the logistic of
    the means, which mathematically characterizes logistic functions; and (3) the
    linearity of the means with respect to sums, as well as products of independent
    variables. The results are also extended to other classes of transfer functions,
    including rectified linear functions. Approximation errors tend to cancel each
    other and do not accumulate. Dropout can also be connected to stochastic neurons
    and used to predict firing rates, and to backpropagation by viewing the backward
    propagation as ensemble averaging in a dropout linear network. Moreover, the convergence
    properties of dropout can be understood in terms of stochastic gradient descent.
    Finally, for the regularization properties of dropout, the expectation of the
    dropout gradient is the gradient of the corresponding approximation ensemble,
    regularized by an adaptive weight decay term with a propensity for self-consistent
    variance minimization and sparse representations.'

  title: Deep learning using linear Support Vector Machines
  container-title: arXiv:1306.0239 \[cs, stat\]
  page: '6'
  note: 'citecount: 00164 arXiv: 1306.0239'
  abstract: Recently, fully-connected and convolutional neural networks have been
    trained to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of tasks such
    as speech recognition, image classification, natural language processing, and
    bioinformatics. For classification tasks, most of these “deep learning” models
    employ the softmax activation function for prediction and minimize cross-entropy
    loss. In this paper, we demonstrate a small but consistent advantage of replacing
    the softmax layer with a linear support vector machine. Learning minimizes a margin-based
    loss instead of the cross-entropy loss. While there have been various combinations
    of neural nets and SVMs in prior art, our results using L2-SVMs show that by simply
    replacing softmax with linear SVMs gives significant gains on popular deep learning
    datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10, and the ICML 2013 Representation Learning Workshop’s
    face expression recognition challenge.

    optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout’s fast approximate

  container-title: arXiv:1611.06310 \[cs, stat\]
  page: '12'
  note: 'citecount: 00001 arXiv: 1611.06310'
  abstract: There has been a lot of recent interest in trying to characterize the
    error surface of deep models. This stems from a long standing question. Given
    that deep networks are highly nonlinear systems optimized by local gradient methods,
    why do they not seem to be affected by bad local minima? It is widely believed
    that training of deep models using gradient methods works so well because the
    error surface either has no local minima, or if they exist they need to be close
    in value to the global minimum. It is known that such results hold under very
    strong assumptions which are not satisfied by real models. In this paper we present
    examples showing that for such theorem to be true additional assumptions on the
    data, initialization schemes and/or the model classes have to be made. We look
    at the particular case of finite size datasets. We demonstrate that in this scenario
    one can construct counter-examples (datasets or initialization schemes) when the
    network does become susceptible to bad local minima over the weight space.

  note: 'citecount: 00000 arXiv: 1704.08424'
  abstract: Word embeddings provide point representations of words containing useful
    semantic information. We introduce multimodal word distributions formed from Gaussian
    mixtures, for multiple word meanings, entailment, and rich uncertainty information.
    To learn these distributions, we propose an energy-based max-margin objective.
    We show that the resulting approach captures uniquely expressive semantic information,
    and outperforms alternatives, such as word2vec skip-grams, and Gaussian embeddings,
    on benchmark datasets such as word similarity and entailment.

  note: 'citecount: 16604'
  abstract: Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor
    and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over
    the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when
    predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates
    of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated
    data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear
    regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital
    element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning
    set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can
    improve accuracy.

  title: Word Representations via Gaussian Embedding
  container-title: arXiv:1412.6623 \[cs\]
  note: 'citecount: 00043 arXiv: 1412.6623'
  abstract: Current work in lexical distributed representations maps each word to
    a point vector in low-dimensional space. Mapping instead to a density provides
    many interesting advantages, including better capturing uncertainty about a representation
    and its relationships, expressing asymmetries more naturally than dot product
    or cosine similarity, and enabling more expressive parameterization of decision
    boundaries. This paper advocates for density-based distributed embeddings and
    presents a method for learning representations in the space of Gaussian distributions.
    We compare performance on various word embedding benchmarks, investigate the ability
    of these embeddings to model entailment and other asymmetric relationships, and
    explore novel properties of the representation.

  note: 'citecount: 00935'
  abstract: While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausible than hyperbolic
    tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks.
    This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological
    neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks
    in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating
    sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally
    sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with
    extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance
    without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with
    large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in
    the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised
    neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt
    with and without unsupervised pre-training.

  container-title: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26
  page: '2814-2822'
  note: 'citecount: 00066'
  abstract: Dropout is a relatively new algorithm for training neural networks which
    relies on stochastically dropping out neurons during training in order to avoid
    the co-adaptation of feature detectors. We introduce a general formalism for studying
    dropout on either units or connections, with arbitrary probability values, and
    use it to analyze the averaging and regularizing properties of dropout in both
    linear and non-linear networks. For deep neural networks, the averaging properties
    of dropout are characterized by three recursive equations, including the approximation
    of expectations by normalized weighted geometric means. We provide estimates and
    bounds for these approximations and corroborate the results with simulations.
    We also show in simple cases how dropout performs stochastic gradient descent
    on a regularized error function.

  title: Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
  page: '770-778'
  note: 'citecount: 02156 Extended version with appendix from the Arxiv'
  abstract: Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual
    learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper
    than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual
    functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced
    functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual
    networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased
    depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to
    152 layers—8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble
    of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result
    won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis
    on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central
    importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep
    representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection
    dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO
    2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection,
    ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.

  note: 'citecount: 00247 arXiv: 1603.05027'
  abstract: 'Deep residual networks have emerged as a family of extremely deep architectures
    showing compelling accuracy and nice convergence behaviors. In this paper, we
    analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual building blocks, which
    suggest that the forward and backward signals can be directly propagated from
    one block to any other block, when using identity mappings as the skip connections
    and after-addition activation. A series of ablation experiments support the importance
    of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit,
    which makes training easier and improves generalization. We report improved results
    using a 1001-layer ResNet on CIFAR-10 (4.62% error) and CIFAR-100, and a 200-layer

  abstract: The problem of constructing a canonical representation for an arbitrary
    continuous piecewise-linear (PWL) function in any dimension is considered in this
    paper. We solve the problem based on a general lattice PWL representation, which
    can be determined for a given continuous PWL function using existing methods.
    We first transform the lattice PWL representation into the difference of two convex
    functions, then propose a constructive procedure to rewrite the latter as a canonical
    representation that consists of at most n-level nestings of absolute-value functions
    in n dimensions, hence give a thorough solution to the problem mentioned above.
    In addition, we point out that there exist notable differences between a lattice
    representation and the two novel general constructive representations proposed
    in this paper, and explain that these differences make all the three representations
    be of their particular interests.

  abstract: The paper characterizes classes of functions for which deep learning can
    be exponentially better than shallow learning. Deep convolutional networks are
    a special case of these conditions, though weight sharing is not the main reason
    for their exponential advantage.

  title: Identity matters in Deep Learning
  container-title: arXiv:1611.04231 \[cs, stat\]
  note: 'citecount: 00001 arXiv: 1611.04231'
  abstract: An emerging design principle in deep learning is that each layer of a
    deep artificial neural network should be able to easily express the identity transformation.
    This idea not only motivated various normalization techniques, such as \\emph{batch
    normalization}, but was also key to the immense success of \\emph{residual networks}.
    In this work, we put the principle of \\emph{identity parameterization} on a more
    solid theoretical footing alongside further empirical progress. We first give
    a strikingly simple proof that arbitrarily deep linear residual networks have
    no spurious local optima. The same result for linear feed-forward networks in
    their standard parameterization is substantially more delicate. Second, we show
    that residual networks with ReLu activations have universal finite-sample expressivity
    in the sense that the network can represent any function of its sample provided
    that the model has more parameters than the sample size. Directly inspired by
    our theory, we experiment with a radically simple residual architecture consisting
    of only residual convolutional layers and ReLu activations, but no batch normalization,
    dropout, or max pool. Our model improves significantly on previous all-convolutional
    networks on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet classification benchmarks.

  title: 'Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal
    Covariate Shift'
  title-short: Batch Normalization
  container-title: arXiv:1502.03167 \[cs\]
  page: '11'
  note: 'citecount: 01618 arXiv: 1502.03167'
  abstract: 'Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution
    of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous
    layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates
    and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models
    with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate
    shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its
    strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing
    the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us
    to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It
    also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied
    to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves
    the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model
    by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve
    upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5
    validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.'

  abstract: 'Many new theoretical challenges have arisen in the area of gradient-based
    optimization for large-scale statistical data analysis, driven by the needs of
    applications and the opportunities provided by new hardware and software platforms.
    I discuss several recent results in this area, including: (1) a new framework
    for understanding Nesterov acceleration, obtained by taking a continuous-time,
    Lagrangian/Hamiltonian perspective, (2) a general theory of asynchronous optimization
    in multi-processor systems, (3) a computationally-efficient approach to variance
    reduction, and (4) a primal-dual methodology for gradient-based optimization that
    targets communication bottlenecks in distributed systems.'
